<body>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>Please read these terms and conditions (T&C) carefully. The T&C describe the rights and obligations of
the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy
 (NABP) and 1) the applicant submitting a
.pharmacy domain application to NABP (Applicant); and 2) the Applicant if its .pharmacy application
is approved by NABP or Applicant, or a third party such as an assignee, if it acquires a .pharmacy domain
name registration (collectively Registrant). Applicant and Registrant may be collectively referred to as
Customer. NABP, Applicant, Registrant, or Customer are each a Party and collectively are Parties.
By submitting an application for a .pharmacy domain or acquiring a .pharmacy domain name, Customer
agrees to comply with these T&C.</li>
<li>NABP is approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) as the
registry for .pharmacy. NABP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation located at 1600 Feehanville Drive,
Mount Prospect, IL 60056, United States of America. NABP operates the .pharmacy Top-Level Domain
(TLD) Program in furtherance of its mission to support its member boards of pharmacy in protecting
public health.</li>
<li>Now, therefore, in consideration of the promises and covenants herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by the Parties, NABP and
Customer agree to the following terms:</li>

<li>1. INFORMATION & MONITORING</li>
</li>1.1 NABP reserves the right to review any and all information available to it to determine whether
Applicant complies with the T&C, Registrant Eligibility requirements, Program Standards, the
Authorized Usage Policy, and .pharmacy TLD Program requirements published on
www.safe.pharmacy or its successor site(s) (collectively Standards). Information that NABP may
review about Customer includes, but is not limited to, the information provided in the application,
information provided to NABP by Applicant or that NABP obtains or receives, whether through the
.pharmacy TLD Program, one or more accreditation programs, or any other NABP program,
publically available information, information available through proprietary sources, and information
that NABP learns from its own investigations. For all applications, NABP reserves the right to request
additional information or documentation from the Customer. Such information shall not be disclosed
by NABP unless: (a) the information is publicly available; (b) the information is legally required to be
disclosed; (c) NABP, its employees, or contractors believe in good faith that a Customer, its owners,
or its affiliates engaged in or are engaging in conduct that violates these T&C, state, federal, country,
or regional law, or ICANN requirements; or (d) as otherwise permitted under these T&C or required
for NABP to perform its obligations under these T&C or as a registry for the .pharmacy domain. If
NABP notifies its member boards of pharmacy or appropriate state, federal, country, or regional
regulatory or law enforcement authorities, or ICANN, NABP agrees to notify Customer to the extent
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOARDS OF PHARMACY
permitted by law. Please note that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the T&C, NABP may
utilize contractors or agents to perform any of its activities or obligations under these T&C.</li>

<li>1.2 If NABP approves the .pharmacy domain application, Registrant agrees to notify NABP of any
changes to the information provided to NABP via the .pharmacy application or other NABPdesignated
document including, but not limited to, change in pharmacist-in-charge, change in
ownership, change in facility name, change in facility location, or the filing or disposition of any
disciplinary action.</li>

<li>1.3 By receiving NABP approval for a .pharmacy domain, Registrant understands that it may be, and
agrees to be, subject to regular monitoring for compliance with the Standards.</li>

<li>2. .pharmacy REGISTRANT ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS, AUTHORIZED USAGE POLICY AND
PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, AND WITHDRAWAL
Customer agrees to comply with the .pharmacy Registrant Eligibility Requirements and Program
Standards (collectively, RES), the .pharmacy Authorized Usage Policy (AUP), and program
requirements published at the www.safe.pharmacy site or its successor site(s), which are hereby
incorporated into the T&C by reference. Customer agrees that NABP may, at its sole discretion, amend
the RES, AUP, or program requirements. If NABP amends the RES, AUP, or program requirements,
NABP will notify Customer by sending a notification to the contact e-mail account provided by Customer
in its .pharmacy domain application. NABP will allow a reasonable amount of time to comply with the
amended RES, AUP, or program requirements, unless the amendment pertains to an ICANN requirement,
law, or regulation that requires Customers immediate compliance. Customer may elect to withdraw the
.pharmacy domain application, decline to register the NABP-approved .pharmacy domain, or discontinue
using the .pharmacy domain that it registered (collectively Withdrawal). In any case of Withdrawal,
Customer agrees to provide written notice of Withdrawal to NABP and the applicable Registrar.
Following receipt of the notice of Withdrawal, NABP shall delete the .pharmacy domain no later than
thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of Withdrawal, unless, in the case of discontinuation of use of a
.pharmacy domain, NABP and Registrant agree in writing to a different date of deletion for the .pharmacy
domain. Customer agrees to discontinue use of the .pharmacy domain for which it submitted the notice of
Withdrawal. The T&C will terminate on the date that NABP deletes the .pharmacy domain. NABP will
return the .pharmacy domain name, which was the basis for Customers application, to the general pool of
.pharmacy domains.</li>

<li>3. APPLICATION DENIAL OR CLOSURE</li>

<li>3.1 NABP reserves the right to refuse to consider any domain application on the basis that the requested
domain is the subject of a previous application, in NABPs sole discretion. Pursuant to the United
States Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 or other applicable laws or ICANN
requirements, NABP may deny an application or delete, remove, transfer, disable, forfeit, or cancel a
domain if the domain name is identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of anothers trademark.</li>

<li>3.2 Upon Applicants submission of a complete, accurate, and truthful .pharmacy application and
payment of the then-current application fee, NABP and/or one of its contactors will review the
application to assess Applicants compliance with the Standards. If NABP obtains information
indicating that Applicant violated or does not comply with the Standards, NABP will send Applicant
a written notice of intent to deny the application to register the .pharmacy domain (Notice of Intent
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOARDS OF PHARMACY
to Deny) and the reason(s) therefor. The Applicant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the
Notice of Intent to Deny to respond. If Applicant does not timely respond, then NABP will send
written notification to Applicant that its .pharmacy application is denied (Denial Notice). If
Applicant responds, NABP will review Applicants response and any additional relevant information
that the Applicant provides in response to the Notice of Intent to Deny. After its review, if NABP
determines that Applicant did not violate and is in compliance with the Standards, then NABP will
rescind the Notice of Intent to Deny by approving Applicant to register the .pharmacy domain for
which Applicant applied and issuing Applicant a registration token. After its review, if NABP
determines that Applicant violated the Standards or is not in compliance with the Standards, NABP
will send Applicant a Denial Notice. Denial Notices and NABPs decision to deny the .pharmacy
application are final and NABP will not reconsider any of its decisions. The T&C terminate effective
on the date of the Denial Notice. Following the Denial Notice, NABP will return the .pharmacy
domain name for which the Applicant had applied to the general pool of .pharmacy domains. If
Applicant reapplies, it must correct all non-compliances described in Notice of Intent to Deny and
meet all then-applicable Standards. If Applicant reapplies for the same or a different .pharmacy
domain, NABP cannot guarantee the availability of the .pharmacy domain that was the basis of the
previous application.</li>

<li>3.3 If NABP has questions about an application or needs additional information, then NABP may send a
written request to the Applicant identifying the specific questions or information requested. The
Applicant shall have thirty (30) days to respond to the NABP request. If Applicant does not respond
to the request for information, then NABP shall close the application and send a Notice of
Application File Closure, and the .pharmacy domain will be placed in the general pool of .pharmacy
domains. If Applicant responds, NABP will review Applicants response and any additional relevant
information that the Applicant provides in response to the NABP request. After its review, if NABP
determines that Applicant meets the Standards, then NABP will approve Applicants .pharmacy
domain application and issue a registration token. After its review, if NABP determines that
Applicant does not meet the Standards, then NABP will send Applicant a Notice of Application File
Closure. Notices of Application File Closure and NABPs decision to close Applicants .pharmacy
application file are final and NABP will not reconsider any of its decisions. The T&C terminate
effective the date of the Notice of Application File Closure. A refund will be issued only per the
Refund Policy in these T&C. Following the Notice of Application File Closure, NABP will return the
.pharmacy domain name to the general pool of .pharmacy domains. If Applicant reapplies, it must
answer all NABP questions or provide the information that NABP requested in connection with the
Applicants previous .pharmacy application and meet all current Standards. Applicant may reapply
for the same or a different .pharmacy domain, but NABP cannot guarantee the availability of the
.pharmacy domain that was the basis of the previous application.</li>

<li>3.4 If NABP receives two or more complete applications for the same domain from different Applicants,
and the completed application received first in time is approved, the application(s) received
subsequently will be closed by NABP. NABP shall send a Notice of Application Closure to the
Applicant. A refund will be issued only per the Refund Policy in these T&C. Applicant may reapply
for a different domain.
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOARDS OF PHARMACY</li>

<li>4. REGISTRATION & REGISTRATION TOKEN</li>
<li>Upon approval of a .pharmacy domain, NABP will provide Registrant with an electronic registration
token. Using the electronic registration token, Registrant must register the .pharmacy domain requested,
within sixty (60) days of approval, with an authorized .pharmacy registrar (Registrar). A list of
authorized .pharmacy Registrars may be found at www.safe.pharmacy or successor site(s). If Registrant
fails to register the .pharmacy domain within sixty (60) days of being approved, the Registrant will forfeit
that .pharmacy domain, and it will be placed in the general pool of .pharmacy domains. If the prior
Registrant wishes to register that .pharmacy domain at a later time when that domain is still available, it
must reapply including paying the then-current .pharmacy application fee.</li>

<li>5. DOMAIN TRANSFER
Registrant is prohibited from transferring, sublicensing, or assigning a .pharmacy domain to another
registrant by any means, except with NABPs prior written consent. Registrant is prohibited from
transferring the registration of a .pharmacy domain from one Registrar to a different Registrar except with
NABPs prior written consent.</li>

<li>6. OWNERSHIP, LICENSE, & RESTRICTIONS ON USE</li>

<li>6.1 All rights, title, and interest in .pharmacy (including all copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual
property rights) are the property of NABP or its ICANN-approved affiliates or successors. Except as
expressly provided below, nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring to any Customer
or its successors any license or right, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise to claim, exercise, or
exploit any copyright or other intellectual property rights.</li>

<li>6.2 Customer agrees that acceptance or approval of a .pharmacy application or acquisition of a .pharmacy
domain name does not constitute a warranty or an endorsement by NABP of Customers products or
services, or Customers compliance with any law or regulation. Customer may not sublicense,
transfer, or assign a .pharmacy domain name without prior written approval of NABP.</li>

<li>7. REFUND POLICY</li>
<li>Customer agrees that there are no refunds of application or registration fees, except if the .pharmacy
domain applied for has been approved by NABP for a different applicant. Such refund will be made in the
same manner that the fee was paid to NABP.</li>

<li>8. SUNRISE DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY AND OTHER DOMAIN DISPUTE DECISIONS</li>

<li>8.1 Through the National Arbitration Forum or any successor organization, NABP provides a mechanism
to resolve disputes in connection with Sunrise registrations. NABPs Sunrise Dispute Resolution
Policy, available at www.safe.pharmacy/standards-policies, describes the process and requirements
for challenging .pharmacy domain names registered during the Sunrise period. NABP and Customer
each agree to abide by the decision made by National Arbitration Forum. In the event that the National
Arbitration Forum decision calls for the transfer of the domain, the designated domain recipient must
first be approved by NABP as compliant with the then-applicable .pharmacy Standards.
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOARDS OF PHARMACY</li>

<li>8.2 In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction or an ICANN-recognized arbitration organization
issues a decision calling for the transfer of a .pharmacy domain name, the designated domain recipient
must first be approved by NABP in writing as compliant with the then-applicable .pharmacy
Standards.</li>

<li>9. DOMAIN DISCONTINUATION BY REGISTRANT & DELETION, SUSPENSION, OR
TERMINATION BY NABP</li>

<li>9.1 Following receipt of written notice that Registrant will discontinue seeking to register a .pharmacy
domain name or wishes to discontinue using a registered .pharmacy domain, NABP will delete the
domain name no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the written notice unless, in the case of
discontinuation of use of a .pharmacy domain, NABP and Registrant agree in writing to a different
date of deletion for the .pharmacy domain. The T&C will automatically terminate on the date that
NABP deletes the .pharmacy domain name. NABP will not issue a refund if Registrant discontinues
seeking to register or using a .pharmacy domain.</li>

<li>9.2 If NABP obtains information indicating the Registrant violated or is not in compliance with the
Standards, NABP will send Registrant a notice of intent to terminate NABPs approval of the
.pharmacy application or delete the .pharmacy domain registration (Notice of Intent to Delete) and
the reason(s) therefor. Registrant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice of Intent to
Delete to respond. If Registrant does not timely respond, then NABP will send written notification to
Registrant that NABPs approval of the .pharmacy application is terminated or that it will delete
Registrants domain registration, as applicable (Deletion Notice). If Registrant timely responds,
NABP will review Registrants response and any additional relevant information that the Registrant
provides in response to the Notice of Intent to Delete. After its review, if NABP determines that
Registrant did not violate and is in compliance with the Standards, then NABP will rescind the Notice
of Intent to Delete and will approve Registrant to register the .pharmacy domain or continue to use the
.pharmacy domain name registration, as applicable. After its review, if NABP determines that
Registrant violated the Standards or is not in compliance with the Standards, NABP will send a
Deletion Notice. The T&C terminate effective on the date of the Deletion Notice. All Deletion Notices
and NABPs decision to terminate its approval for the .pharmacy domain or to delete the .pharmacy
domain name registration are final and NABP will not consider any internal appeal of its decisions.
Following the Deletion Notice, NABP will return the .pharmacy domain name that was the basis for
the Customers application to the general pool of .pharmacy domains. If Registrant reapplies, it must
correct all non-compliances with the Standards described in Notice of Intent to Delete and meet all
then-applicable Standards. Registrant may reapply for the same or a different .pharmacy domain, but
NABP cannot guarantee the availability of the .pharmacy domain that was the basis of the previous
application.</li>

<li>9.3 NABP reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately suspend Registrants .pharmacy
domain or NABPs approval of Registrants .pharmacy domain application if NABP obtains

to delete Registrants domain, and provide Registrant with the opportunity to respond. Within 30 days
of the date of the Suspension Notice, Registrant may submit a response to NABP, including any
available documentation to substantiate Registrants response. If Registrant does not timely respond,
then NABP will send written notification to Registrant that NABPs approval of the .pharmacy
domain application is terminated or that it deleted Registrants .pharmacy domain registration
(Deletion Notice). If Registrant timely responds, NABP will review Registrants response and any
relevant information that the Registrant provides in response to the Suspension Notice. After its
review, if NABP determines that Registrant did not engage in any Violation and is compliant with the
Standards, then NABP will rescind the Suspension Notice and will confirm its approval for Registrant
to register the requested .pharmacy domain or reinstate Registrants .pharmacy domain name
registration, as applicable. After its review, if NABP in its sole discretion determines that Registrant
engaged in a Violation, NABP will send a Deletion Notice. The T&C terminate effective on the date
of the Deletion Notice. All Suspension and Deletion Notices and NABPs decisions to suspend
Registrants .pharmacy domain, suspend its approval of Registrants .pharmacy domain, or to delete
Registrants .pharmacy domain name registration are final and NABP will not reconsider any of its
decisions. Following the Deletion Notice, NABP will return the .pharmacy domain name that was the
basis for the Registrants application to the general pool of .pharmacy domains. If Registrant reapplies
after receiving a Deletion Notice, it must correct all Violations described in Suspension Notice and
meet all then-applicable Standards. Registrant may reapply for the same or a different .pharmacy
domain, but NABP cannot guarantee the availability of the .pharmacy domain that was the basis of the
previous application.</li>

<li>9.4. If Customer fails to pay the application or registration fees when due, NABP will send Customer
written notification of impending termination of NABPs consideration of the application, approval of
the .pharmacy domain, or deletion of Registrants .pharmacy domain name registration. If Customer
does not timely pay all applicable fees within thirty (30) days of the date of such notification, NABP
will terminate its consideration of the application, its approval of the .pharmacy domain or delete the

request for information or if Registrant does not provide all NABP-requested documentation within 30
days of the date of a Notice of Intent to Delete. NABP will terminate its approval of the .pharmacy

<li>9.6 If Customer applies for or is accredited or approved by NABP through one or more current or future
NABP accreditation or approval programs including, without limitation, the Verified-Accredited
Wholesale Distributors
 (VAWD), Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites
 (VIPPS), or Durable
Medical Equipment Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS), and its application is denied or
Customer is disqualified from one of the NABP accreditation or approval programs, Customer hereby
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOARDS OF PHARMACY
agrees that the application denial or disqualification is grounds for denial of Customers .pharmacy
application or temporary suspension, termination of approval, or deletion of Customers .pharmacy
domain and that NABP may deny, temporarily suspend, terminate its approval, or delete Customers
.pharmacy domain pursuant to the requirements of the T&C. NABP will return any denied or deleted
domain name(s) to the general pool of .pharmacy domains. If Customer reapplies, it must correct all
non-compliances described in the applicable notice, including the Notice of Intent to Deny or Notice
of Deletion, and meet all then-applicable Standards. If Customers application for a .pharmacy
domain name is denied or its .pharmacy domain name(s) are deleted or NABP terminates its approval
of Customers .pharmacy domain name(s), then Customer hereby agrees that the denial of the
.pharmacy application or deletion or termination of approval of its .pharmacy domain name(s) is
grounds for loss of qualification under the accreditation or approval program letter of agreement
(LOA) and NABP may suspend or disqualify Customer from one or more NABP accreditation or
approval programs pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable LOA(s).</li>

<li>9.7 Customer must notify NABP in writing of any change in its ownership, including if Customer is
merged, acquired by, or consolidated with another organization within 30 days of any such change. In
such circumstance, NABP may, in its sole reasonable discretion, require Customer to reapply for
approval of a .pharmacy domain. In such circumstance, NABP shall send a written notice advising the
Customer that it must complete the .pharmacy application, submit the then-applicable payment, and
meet the then-applicable Standards. In the case of a Registrant, its .pharmacy domain will remain
active for 30 days, while the Registrant prepares its .pharmacy application for submission. If
Registrant fails to reapply within those 30 days, then NABP will send Registrant a Deletion Notice. If
Registrant timely applies and NABP determines that Registrant meets the then-applicable Standards,
then Registrants .pharmacy domain will remain active for the remaining balance of the 12-month
term, and NABP will send Registrant written notification thereof. If Registrant timely applies and
NABP has questions about the application or needs information, then NABP shall send a written
request to the Registrant identifying the specific questions or information requested. The Registrant
shall have 30 days to respond to the NABP request. If Registrant does not timely respond to the
NABP request, the application will be closed and NABP will send Registrant notification that its
application file was closed and the Registrants domain will be deleted. Thereafter, the .pharmacy
domain will be placed in the general pool of .pharmacy domains. If Registrant timely responds, NABP
will review Registrants response and any additional relevant information that the Registrant provides
in response to the NABP request. After its review, if NABP determines that Registrant meets the
Standards, then Registrants .pharmacy domain will remain active for the remaining balance of the 12-
month term, and NABP will send Registrant written notification thereof. After its review, if NABP
determines that Registrant does not meet the Standards, the application will be closed, NABP will
send Registrant notification that its application file was closed and Registrants domain will be
deleted. Thereafter the .pharmacy domain will be placed in the general pool of .pharmacy domains.
NABPs decisions to close Registrants .pharmacy application and delete its .pharmacy domain
registration are final and NABP will not reconsider any of its decisions. The T&C terminate effective
on the date of the Deletion Notice. A refund will be issued only in accordance with the Refund Policy
in these T&C. If Registrant reapplies, it must answer all NABP questions or provide the information
that NABP requested in connection with the previous .pharmacy application and meet all thenapplicable
Standards. Registrant may reapply for the same or a different .pharmacy domain, but
NABP cannot guarantee the availability of the .pharmacy domain that was the basis of the previous
application.

Customer grants NABP a nonexclusive, transferrable (except for the logo), royalty-free worldwide license
to publish and use in .pharmacy materials, Customers name, logo, address, website address, and its date of
approval of the .pharmacy domain application, along with other information required by ICANN.</li>

<li>11. TERM
The term of a domain name is twelve (12) months, which begins upon the date the domain name is
registered with a Registrar. The Registrant must reapply annually to maintain the .pharmacy domain
name. NABP reserves the right to suspend or delete a domain name during the term, consistent with these
T&C. Termination of Customers registration or deletion of Customers .pharmacy domain does not
relieve Customer of liability for obligations that relate to activities occurring before such termination or
deletion.</li>

<li>12. RENEWAL
One hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary of the domain name registration date (120-Day
Notice), each successive year during which the domain name is active, Registrar will advise Registrant
to complete the annual .pharmacy TLD Program application form (found at www.safe.pharmacy/ apply,
or successor site(s)) to reapply for the domain name. Registrar will send a reapplication notice to the
Registrant thirty (30) days after the date of the 120-Day Notice. If Registrant has not reapplied within
sixty (60) days of the anniversary of the domain name registration date, Registrar will advise Registrant
that if the reapplication is not processed prior to the anniversary date, the domain name may be suspended
and ultimately deleted. If the Registrant has not reapplied within thirty (30) days of the anniversary of the
domain name registration date, Registrar will advise Registrant that the domain name is at risk of being
suspended and ultimately deleted. If the Registrant reapplies within five (5) days of the anniversary of the
domain name registration date, NABP cannot guarantee that it will be able to review and, if Registrant
meets all Standards, approve the domain renewal request prior to the anniversary date. If by the
anniversary date NABP has not completed its review of the application that Customer submitted within
five (5) days of the anniversary date, NABP may, in its sole discretion, suspend the domain name pending
NABPs review and approval of Customers application. If NABP decides to suspend the domain name,
NABP will notify the Registrar regarding the domain suspension and will send a notice to the Customer
that is domain is suspended pending NABPs review and approval of Customers application. If the
Customer has not reapplied as of the anniversary date, NABP will notify the Registrar to suspend the
domain name and send a notice to the Customer that its domain is suspended pending NABPs review and
approval of Customers application. A Customer that has not submitted its application prior to the
anniversary date shall be given thirty (30) additional days to reapply (Redemption Grace Period) during
which time the domain will remain suspended. After the expiration of the Redemption Grace Period, if the
Customer has not timely reapplied, the domain name will be deleted by NABP and placed into the general
pool of .pharmacy domains. Customer may reapply for the same or a different .pharmacy domain, but
NABP cannot guarantee the availability of the .pharmacy domain that was the basis of the previous
application.
If NABP approves the renewal of the domain name, Customer may register the domain name for another
year. Registrar will collect the applicable registration fee. NABP and Customer agree that review and
handling of Customers .pharmacy TLD Program application for renewal of its .pharmacy domain will be
handled in accordance with the then-current terms and conditions for the .pharmacy TLD Program.
